Perfect ‚öîÔ∏è ‚Äî here‚Äôs a **focused list of medium-level Sliding Window problems** from LeetCode.
These are the core ‚Äúreal interview‚Äù challenges that test your reasoning, not just pattern recognition.

I‚Äôve grouped them by **concept type** so you can master them strategically.

Would you like me to create a **visual cheat sheet** (with window type, when to move left/right, and common patterns like ‚Äúexpand‚Äìshrink‚Äù and ‚Äúcount map‚Äù)? It‚Äôs an awesome 1-page summary for window problems.
