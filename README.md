### ⚙️ **Recommended Practice Path**

1. Start simple:
   `Add Two Numbers → Remove Nth Node → Swap Nodes`
2. Then go deeper:
   `Reverse Linked List II → Reorder List → Sort List`
3. Then apply concepts to design / data conversion:
   `Copy List with Random Pointer → Convert Sorted List to BST`
4. Finally, challenge your pointer logic:
   `Linked List Cycle II → Odd Even Linked List → Split Linked List in Parts`
