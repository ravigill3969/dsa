🌳 Traversal & Views

Level Order Traversal (BFS) – Print nodes level by level.

Zigzag Level Order Traversal – Like BFS, but alternate directions each level.

Boundary Traversal – Print all boundary nodes (left boundary, leaves, right boundary).

Vertical Order Traversal – Group nodes column by column.

Top View & Bottom View of Binary Tree – Using BFS + map.

🌿 Structural Properties

Check if Two Trees are Identical.

Check if a Tree is Symmetric (Mirror).

Height of a Binary Tree.

Diameter of a Binary Tree (longest path between two leaves).

Balanced Binary Tree Check (difference in heights ≤ 1).

🌱 Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) & Ancestors

Lowest Common Ancestor in a Binary Tree.

Print All Ancestors of a Given Node.

Distance Between Two Nodes in a Tree.

🍂 Path Problems

Root-to-Leaf Path Sum – Check if a path exists with a given sum.

All Root-to-Leaf Paths – Print all possible paths.

Maximum Path Sum in Binary Tree.

Longest Path with Equal Values.

🌾 Transformations

Invert a Binary Tree (mirror it).

Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List (preorder sequence).

Convert Binary Tree to Doubly Linked List (DLL).

🌟 Bonus (Trickier but Doable)

Serialize & Deserialize a Binary Tree.

Construct Tree from Inorder & Preorder Traversal.

Construct Tree from Inorder & Postorder Traversal.

Kth Smallest/Largest in BST.

Validate if a Tree is a BST.
